# Graph Traversal - BFS in Python

This repository contains an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python using an adjacency matrix representation.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Implements BFS for directed graphs using an adjacency matrix.
- Uses `collections.deque` for efficient queue operations.
- Tracks visited nodes to prevent infinite loops.
- Prints BFS traversal step-by-step.

## ðŸ“Œ Code Overview
The `BFS` class initializes with a graph (as an adjacency matrix) and a source node. The `st_bfs()` function performs BFS and prints the traversal order.

### ðŸ”¹ Example Graph
The graph is represented as a **2D adjacency matrix**:
